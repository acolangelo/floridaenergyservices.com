# SvelteKit Starter

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Developing

Install dependencies with `npm install`, and then start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
