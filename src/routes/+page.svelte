	<h2>Our History</h2>
	<p>Florida Energy Services, Inc. (FES) was founded more than 40 years ago (1982) in Crystal River, Florida.</p>
	<p>In 1992, FES expanded into the Naples/Ft. Myers, Florida market. Over the next 30 years, FES maintained its stringent training programs, held and maintained State of Florida User’s Licenses and Blaster’s Permits, maintained multiple Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) certifications, and many of its professionals are active members in good standing of the International Society of Explosive Engineers.</p>
	<p>FES’s worksite safety training, meticulous blast design, communication with prime contractors and other stakeholders, and adherence to state, county, and municipal rules and regulations concerning blasting has placed FES as the preeminent drilling and blasting contractor in the South Florida market.</p>
	<p>FES provides drilling and blasting services for the construction, infrastructure and mining industries throughout the state of Florida, including site preparation for building of commercial, industrial, and residential developments, lakes, golf courses, canals, waterways, reservoirs, storm water detention ponds and underground utilities.</p>
	<p>Often these projects are done in phases and later phase construction occurs while earlier phases are occupied with residents. FES has refined their blasting technique to allow for blasting within 350 feet of an occupied structure by using light weight charges, 6-, 9-, 12-, 16- and 20-pound charges, while maintaining the required vibration limits set by the governing agency.</p>
	<p>FES has recently expanded its quarry drilling from depths of 20-40 feet to depths of up to 100 feet.</p>
	<p>Over the past 40 years, FES has worked on multiple projects with the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACOE).</p>
